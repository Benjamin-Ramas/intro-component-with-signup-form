## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

1. I first started by recreating the general layout so even without styling the placement of the elements should closely align with what I am trying to achieve

2. I then started blocking them out giving each element a background colour to distinguish the areas what areas they take up more clearly. This step generally has the most drastic changes style wise as I move around the different parts until I am satisfied.

3. Once I am satisfied with the general layout I start polishing by adding all the smaller details such as font weight, font size, border radius, proper background colour, etc.

4. I then focus on creating the javascript required to check the validity of the form. As well as any required tweaks to the html and css

### Built with
